# Fake News Classification

## What is it?

* LIAR-PLUS is a benchmark dataset for fake news detection, released recently.
* This dataset has evidence sentences extracted automatically from the full-text verdict report written by journalists in **Politifact**.
* It consists of **12,836** short statements taken from **Politifact** and labeled by humans for truthfulness, subject, context/venue, speaker, state, party, and prior history.
* For truthfulness, the LIAR dataset has six labels: **pants-fire**, **false**, **mostly-false**, **half-true**, **mostly-true** and **true**.
* These six label sets are relatively balanced in size.
* There are two tasks:
	1. Binary classification task (true, false)
	2. Six-way classification task (pants on fire, false, mostly false, half-true, mostly true, true)
